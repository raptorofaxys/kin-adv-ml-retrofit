3D files to help retrofit Cherry ML switches into Kinesis Advantage V1 keyboards.

I have designed and used these files to replace the rubber dome function key switches in Kinesis Advantage V1 keyboards with Cherry ML switches such as the ones that are used in V2 of the same keyboard.

This mod is not overly difficult, but it does require the use of a few unconventional techniques. You can see a full retrofit from start to finish here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EFNTh-arPk

Alternatively, you can watch the process in much more exploratory detail in this series of videos:
